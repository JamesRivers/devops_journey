I did not write all of this material, Matt Cade initially ran this in Q1 2022, thanks @MichaelCade for the notes, insights and knowledge. Please go and review the original 90 days of devops at https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps

This repository i have created as I go on the same journey, and I will use the initial documentation as a base  to getting a better foundational knowledge of DevOps. I will add additional items that I find of benefit that add to my learning path. Matts idea was that we take 90 days, and spend an hr each day growing our knowledge each day in the devops world.  I will try and do the same - might not be 90 days... 

This will not cover all things DevOps but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.  This will not cover items specific to your company and how your dev teams create software, or how your ops teams handle deployments, but more of a generic view.
